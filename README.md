# Flamangos - 12773 JavaBot Code

This GIT repository contains Java code for our robot

## Description
We have at least 3 files for each of the projects. 
1. Hardware description 
2. Autonomous
3. TeleOp

We may have few more in as the project evolves


## Procedure
### Limitations
Limitations of the OnBot Java (on Rev Hub atleast !)
- It cannot handle multiple projects easily; if one project has errors, you cannot use any other project
until all errors fixed in all the projects
- The simplest solution is to load one project and work on it 
- It is not a good idea to leave code on the RevModule; always backup your work. 

### Process
To be successful and free of frustration, we need to follow the follow these steps:
- Backup the contents to your laptop from the RevHub (so that accidentally you do not delete other's work)
- Upload your files and start working on them
- once you are at a logical point, download a copy and do a GIT Commit and repeat this 
- at the end of the session, do one last download (even if it not in a good shape), and commit
- At the end of the day PUSH all the changes to GIT. 

### Installing

Download this to your pc; upload it to REV module; You will have to delete all the old files; but be careful before you do it.
